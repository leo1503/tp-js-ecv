<h2 class="remove">Question 7 :</h2>
<p class="remove">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br />
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br />
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br />
  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br />
  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br />
  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum <br /></p>
